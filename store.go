// Store is the persistence seam for policy data: three typed tables (custom
// roles, user-role memberships, role grants), each row held where its
// accesstypes.PolicyScope says — the global partition, one tenant domain or
// every tenant domain, persisted as the structural column triple (Kind, Axis,
// Domain) — plus one normalized read feeding the snapshot compiler. The
// release's default roles have no rows: the store holds only what is written
// at run time. Implementations are thin — each method is one SQL statement
// against one store's tables; everything smarter (validation, resource/field
// splitting, change signaling, snapshot compilation) lives in the access
// package, one shared code path for every store.
//
// The interface is sealed by construction: ReadPolicy's signature references
// this module's internal/policy package, so only packages inside this module
// can implement it. Use the provided implementations:
//
//	spannerstore.New(client, opts...)   // Cloud Spanner
//	postgresstore.New(pool, opts...)    // PostgreSQL, rides the app's pgx pool
//
// Store values hold bare names only — no marshal prefixes, no sentinel
// values. All values are opaque labels to the store: referential validity of
// domains, users, resources and role names belongs to the callers that write
// them. Where a row is held is stored structurally: the kind column names the
// global partition, one domain or every domain, never a distinguished domain
// value, so any domain string is ordinary tenant data. The axis column names
// the axis a domain belongs to and is the empty string for the default axis —
// the only axis a scope can name today, so every row carries "" and a later
// axis declaration changes no stored row. A row under any other axis fails
// the policy read rather than folding into the default.
//
// Contracts every implementation provides:
//   - Inserts are idempotent: re-inserting an existing row is a no-op, not an
//     error. Deletes of absent rows are no-ops.
//   - A membership names a role by name alone: InsertUserRole writes it
//     whether or not a role row exists, since the role may be one of the
//     release's defaults, which have no row. The access package checks that
//     the name resolves before it writes.
//   - DeleteRole is scoped to (scope, role): it cascades the role's grants,
//     refuses with an error while memberships held in that scope still name
//     the role (checked in the same transaction as the delete), and reports
//     whether a row was actually deleted.
//   - InsertGrant requires the (scope, role) row to exist (DB-enforced
//     parent interleave or foreign key): a grant is a custom role's.
//   - ChangeGrants applies a role's removals and additions in one transaction,
//     so a grant whose condition changed (one row removed, one added) is never
//     seen with neither row.
//   - List results are sorted for deterministic output.
//   - ReadPolicy reads roles, grants and memberships with snapshot
//     consistency: the row sets observe the same store state.

	// resource "" (with field "") is a scope-wide grant — the permission held

	// above this seam, so "" is structurally unreachable from data.
	// condition is the grant's condition as opaque expression text, "" when
	// unconditional, and is part of the row's identity: one (role,
	// permission, resource, field) holds one row per condition, so a role may
	// grant the same permission on one resource under several conditions.

	// ChangeGrants removes the role's removals and adds its additions as one
	// transaction: a reader sees the role's grants before the change or after
	// it, never between, and a failure leaves them as they were. Additions

	// absent rows are no-ops; nothing to change is a no-op. Same parent-row
