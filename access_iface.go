// opaque partition labels: no method validates tenant existence — the
// application owns its tenant list and validates tenants at its own
// boundaries.
//
// Roles are of two kinds. The release's default roles come from the role file
// (WithDefaultRoles): a global default is held in the global partition, a
// domain default in every tenant domain; they exist without a store row, a
// membership names them by name, their grants are the file's and are read
// here, never written. Custom roles are the store's: created, granted and
// deleted through this interface, held where they were created. A default
// role's name is taken: a custom role cannot be created under it, and a
// custom role that predates a default of the same name is shadowed by it (see
// ShadowedRole).
//
// The base-name/Resources-suffix pairing is the API's naming standard: the
// base method addresses a permission held scope-wide (attached to no
// resource); the Resources variant addresses specific resources.
